# Rube-Goldberg-Machine-Maker
## Introduction
This is a VR game developed with the Unity engine as part of the Nanodegree offered by Udacity. The game prompts the player to create a Rube Goldberg machine out of a list of spawnable items where the player has to release a ball so it traverses the scene until it reaches a designated goal - all while having gathered some collectables.
